## Description
<p>The application is a one-year project to finalize the technical course of systems development integrated to the high school of Etec Vila Formosa. The purpose of the app is to help small business owners with information about profits, costs and other data relevant to the management of their business.</p> 

## Target Audience
<p>Due to the project's purpose, the target audience are Brazilian entrepreneurs, so the app is completely in Portuguese with comments in our native language throughout the code, however the code is mostly in English to follow an international standard and help other programmers who want to use our project as a help for their own projects.</p>

<p>For the Brazilian public, the project will be available in the virtual store of the Android platform.</p>

## And the Backend?
<p>Unfortunately, to keep the data of the users who use the application secure, the backend will not be available in open source like this project.</p>
